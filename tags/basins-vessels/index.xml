&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This small garden was located at the rear of the house and featured a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> on part of the south side and a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052565">gutter&lt;/a> along the south and east sides which carried water to the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558">cistern&lt;/a>. Preserved on the rear wall was one of the best animal paintings found in Pompeii, with three large openings provided in the painting to accommodate garden lights. On either side of the animal painting at the lower part of the wall is a garden painting with a sphinx crouching in oleanders with dark red blossoms holding a fountain basin. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> on the right would appear to pour water into the actual &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052565">gutter&lt;/a> below. A realistic border of myrtle (&lt;em>Myrtus communis L.&lt;/em>) and ivy (&lt;em>Hedera helix L.&lt;/em>) is painted along the bottom of the wall with birds flying across a red background. Just above this, branches of ivy are painted along the bottom of an expansive wild animal scene. A bull is being pursued by a lion across a rocky lake shore on the lower foreground, wolves and wild boars occupy the center of the picture on the opposite shore, on the right a leopard is chasing two rams, and two gazelles are painted on the left. Brackets for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300183142">garden lights&lt;/a> had been installed where three large holes remained in this animal painting. The outside walls of the &lt;em>apotheca&lt;/em> (storeroom) on the southwest corner of the garden had painted garden motifs. There was a garden scene painted on a reddish background depicting a statue of a water nymph with a two handled basin appearing to catch water from the roof and directing it to the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052565">gutter&lt;/a> below. To the left are bushes with a tawny owl (&lt;em>Strix aluco L.&lt;/em>) and to the right is a white pigeon or rock dove (&lt;em>Columba livia Gmelin&lt;/em>). Over this was a panel with two peacocks (&lt;em>Pavo cristatus L.&lt;/em>) facing a bronze garden ornament that consists of a leafy stalk topped by a round shield. Flowering plants fill in the bottom while the top of the panel is graced with two garlands and two flying birds, a swallow (&lt;em>Hirundo rustica L.&lt;/em>) on the left and a large headed bird on the right which could be a shrike (&lt;em>Lanius sp.&lt;/em>) Although the outside wall of the &lt;em>apotheca&lt;/em> was badly damaged, to the right of the window paintings of a bush with red blossoms and a myrtle bush on a yellow background survived. The east and west walls were decorated with large Egyptian landscapes. Another garden decoration, a marble dove (0.29 m. long) was found in the kitchen.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the faÃ§ade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its faÃ§ade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE âthe Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venusâ (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the course of recent excavations in a room (a) of this house a probable garden area was uncovered (Fig. 1). Only its southern limits, represented by the perimeter wall of an otherwise unidentified building, could be traced. The archaeological sequence established by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy">stratigraphy&lt;/a> of this garden area dates it between the early 2nd and early 3rd century CE. It is characterized by a series of superimposed levels of beaten earth, interrupted by small channels, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthole">postholes&lt;/a> and larger pits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One significant level of these successive transformations of the area is represented by a layer which was cut to provide the support for a kind of rectangular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300010669">terracotta&lt;/a> container. It rested directly on the earth, and was perhaps used as a watering basin. Probably connected with this object is a small channel running parallel to it, 10 cm deep and 30 cm wide, paved with pottery fragments. To the south of this channel a pit was located, its edge lined with pottery fragments. It is flanked by two smaller and shallower holes (respectively 12 and 16 cm in diameter), perhaps for small shrubs or poles. Probably slightly later is another layout of the garden, represented by a beaten earth level cut by a pit (&lt;em>c&lt;/em>.22 cm wide, 10 cm deep). Found embedded inside it was a large, upturned upper part of a &lt;a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/amphora_ahrb_2005/details.cfm?id=83">Dressel 20&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora#cite_note-12">amphora&lt;/a>, possibly used as a planting pot.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the faÃ§ade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its faÃ§ade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE âthe Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venusâ (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The entrance of this house (Fig. 1) (which takes its name from the statuary group found in room b) provides access to a large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> (a) with four columns on marble bases, resting on a continuous marble-paneled &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001989">balustrade&lt;/a> 50 cm high. To the right of the portico was an area believed to be a garden (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium">&lt;em>viridarium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) (c) terminating in a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">nymphaeum&lt;/a>. This consisted of a podium 1.10 m. high, paneled in white marble. Hewn into its front side are five deep circular niches. Four are paneled in white marble; only the central niche is panelled in green &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipollino_marble">cipollino marble&lt;/a>. The architectural elevation of the nymphaeum rises from this podium (Fig. 2). Over four meters high, it consists of two rectangular alternating with three semicircular niches, framed by six marble columns with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_order">Corinthian&lt;/a> capitals and rectangular travertine &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001749">plinths&lt;/a>, from which little brick arches project. Five marble stepped gradients were placed between the bases of the columns. They formed miniature cascades: the water piped in by the lead conduit that ran along the bases of the niches flowed down over them. The water filled small rectangular basins and, flowing through &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300010669">terracotta&lt;/a> channels inside the podium, spouted from four outlets placed between the niches. The whole of the podium together with the stepped cascades was paneled in white marble and green &lt;em>cipollino&lt;/em>; the upper part, by contrast, was stuccoed and adorned with a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300252261">polychrome&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015342">wall mosaic&lt;/a>. A tile-covered drain ran through the entire length of the podium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium">&lt;em>viridarium&lt;/em>&lt;/a> is the main source of light for all the rooms that face on it, including the large reception room (d) (Fig. 3). The house is a typical example of an Ostian patrician house of the early 4th century CE.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its faÃ§ade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE âthe Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venusâ (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyle&lt;/a> garden (Fig. 1, a) has &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011329">travertine&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> on three sides. The fourth side coincides with the perimeter wall of the house, which forms part of the original plan, dating to the 2nd century CE. The last phase of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, lavishly decorated with precious marbles, dates to the 4th century CE. Against the rear wall of the garden is a brick &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704">niche&lt;/a> (h. 194 cm.; w. 114 cm.) containing a statue of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)">Juno&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter">Demeter&lt;/a> and two benches in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_vittatum">&lt;em>opus listatum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (w. 41 cm.; preserved h. 28 cm.). âThe area inside the peristyle must undoubtedly have been kept as a garden (Figs. 2 and 3). The remains of a rectangular basin (3.10x5.40 m.) with drainage outlet at its north-east corner were found at its centerâ (Becatti).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300152327">well&lt;/a> (diam. 49 cm.) in the eastern part of the garden; it is adorned with a marble &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300443458">well-head&lt;/a> decorated with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300030853">bucrania&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020212">neo-attic&lt;/a> style, dating to the 2nd century CE (dia. 66 cm; h. 55 cm) (Fig. 4). Two small &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047170">herms&lt;/a> also formed part of the garden decoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A large female &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> was found &lt;em>in situ&lt;/em> on its pedestal, adhering to the end-wall of the western portico of the peristyle. Endowed with the attributes of trade (&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300303413">cornucopia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubernaculum_(classical)">oar&lt;/a>), the female figure has been identified as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna">&lt;em>Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, the personification of Ostiaâs trading success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large apsidal reception room (&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080791">&lt;em>oecus&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) (Fig. 1, b), with two columns marking its entrance, was located in the western part of the house. The garden, with flowering plants, onto which it opens, formed its natural continuation. This, together with the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">&lt;em>nymphaeum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> that decorated the south side of the room, its rear wall articulated with alternating semicircular and rectangular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704">niches&lt;/a> containing statues, provided a suitably splendid and prestige-enhancing setting for the public life of the owner, probably a wealthy trader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The garden also forms the backdrop to the rooms in the east part of the house, a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">&lt;em>triclinium&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (Fig. 1, c) and a heated cubicle (Fig. 1, d), lit by a large window and decorated with a lavish black and white &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015342">mosaic&lt;/a> floor with mythological scenes.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the faÃ§ade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its faÃ§ade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE âthe Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venusâ (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This house was only partially excavated between June 1972 and January 1973 (Fig. 1). In its &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020543">Augustan&lt;/a> phase the peristyle garden (a) was adorned with a large central basin paved in &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300379969">opus signinum&lt;/a>. At the center of the basin was a brick support, interpreted as the base of a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyle&lt;/a>, probably &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300067420">Tuscan&lt;/a>, rested on bases alternating with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011329">travertine&lt;/a> strips at pavement level (Fig. 2). Three perforated vases of the type of &lt;em>ollae perforatae&lt;/em> recorded by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder">Cato&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cato/cato.agri.html">RR 52, 133&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/RRCatoA">Trans.&lt;/a>) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:12.16">NH 12. 16&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:17.64">17. 64&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:17.97">97&lt;/a>) were found between the basin and the columns of the peristyle, and exactly aligned with their bases. The &lt;em>ollae&lt;/em> were intact and must have contained plants, no doubt of the flowering and rambling variety, which would have found both a support and a chromatic backdrop in the columns to the rear.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the faÃ§ade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its faÃ§ade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE âthe Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venusâ (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the original plan of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020543">Augustan&lt;/a> period the garden area to the back of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007117">theater&lt;/a> was surrounded on three sides by a roofed corridor opening onto the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a> on the northern side with a monumental entrance. In the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020545">Claudian&lt;/a> period the whole level of the area was raised and a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> consisting of a single row of brick &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> added. A temple was built at the center of the garden area in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500083758">Domitianic&lt;/a> period; traditionally identified since its discovery (1881) with the temple of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(mythology)">Ceres&lt;/a>, it has more recently been attributed to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(mythology)">Vulcan&lt;/a> or to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult_of_ancient_Rome">imperial cult&lt;/a>. During the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300107350">Hadrianic&lt;/a> period the portico was doubled with a second row of columns; the entrances on the northern side were blocked, and buildings erected against them, making access to the garden possible only from the theater (Fig. 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The open area to the back of the theater was never built over. Laid out as a garden, and adorned with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statues&lt;/a> raised in honor of men who had distinguished themselves in trade, it conformed to the recommendation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.1">5.9.1&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.9.1">(English)&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.5">5.9.5&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.9.5">(English)&lt;/a>), that areas surrounding a theater be laid out with colonnades (&lt;em>post scaenam porticus&lt;/em>) and embellished with gardens, where people could stroll about and converse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the excavations of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Lanciani">Rodolfo Lanciani&lt;/a> (1881) âa street traversing the excavated area of the Forum and aligned on the axis of the temple and the theatreâ was identified (Fig. 2). Reported to be âgravelled and edged with marble bordersâ, this street was probably a path of the garden that led from the theater to the temple at the center of the area: âThe Forum of Ceres &amp;hellip; was once ornamented with a garden, the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300178561">&lt;em>allÃ©es&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of which can still be traced with the help of the marble border-lines by which each plot of green was defined and surrounded.â&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the excavations of &lt;a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vaglieri">Dante Vaglieri&lt;/a> (1910-1913), a system of conduits was identified. It was linked to a large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006122">sewer&lt;/a> that ran underground at the center of the garden area, sloping downwards from south to north in the direction of the Tiber (Fig. 3). Two conduits parallel to the central sewer ran in front of the &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/statio#Latin">&lt;em>stationes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. At garden level there were two long gutters that collected rainwater from the roof of the portico. Two basins (respectively 3.10x2.90 and 3.45x3.35 m) at ground level were identified on the southern side of the garden; they were paved with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300379969">&lt;em>opus signinum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> on the inside and probably panelled in marble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 1912 Dante Vaglieri began the reconstruction of the garden at the center of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni (Fig. 4). He commissioned a famous landscape architect of the period to create a garden with rectangular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300184573">parterres&lt;/a> of various size which retraced in part the layout of the allÃ©es and &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300239937">flower-beds&lt;/a> of the ancient garden: âThis garden, reconstructed by one of our cleverest landscape artists, with its display of classic bushes and flowers, its colonnade lining the four sides of the square, and its array of statues of eminent men, bankers, merchants, magistrates, harbour-masters, &amp;amp;c., has become the chief attraction to the visitors of Ostiaâ¦â The leading experts in garden architecture of the period included Pier Andrea and Domenico Saccardi: perhaps one of them was the âcleverest landscape artist.â&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="province-description">Province Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms. It was fixed at the river of Ampsaga during Caesarâs reign when he rewarded his ally King Bocchus, giving him part of the Numidian kingdom. By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The city of Cuicul, modern Djemila in Algeria, was a Roman colony founded by Trajan at the beginning of the second century. It was located near the western frontier of Numidia, at a crossroads near the High Plain of Setif and south of the actual âLittle Kabylieâ region. The original city center was constructed on a spur set between two merging wadi, the Gergour and the Betame, at an altitude of about eight hundred meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains more than a thousand meters above sea level. There are snow falls and freezing cold in winter and plenty of water. For the most part, the climate exc1udes plants which cannot stand the frost; however, we can infer the presence of olive plantations due to the number of olive presses found throughout the town.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This house of irregular shape (Plan view, Fig. 1), rested against the ancient city wall, transformed into a decorative wall for the Severian Forum, and between two large cardines. It was excavated in 1911.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can see the complex building of Late Antiquity (1500 m2), centered around the peristyle, with a large central area (8.10 x 7.70 m) (Fig. 1). The bases of the columns (four on each side) are not visible; therefore, they seem to lay on a lower level, hidden by later phase of construction. During the first half of the fifth century, low walls were set against the columns, except on the west side, where the open area was entered from the gallery. On the north side, an apse, paved with a mosaic representing a shell, encroaches upon the inner space. On the east side, in front of the large exedra XVIII, a mass of masonry includes three small semi-circular pools. A large rectangular fish pool rests against the mass of masonry; there are little terracotta amphoras inside the edges. At the center of this pool, rose a tall hexagonal base engraved with an ivy scroll and unreadable inscriptions, standing on a hollow base. The peristyle galleries were paved with mosaics: there were geometric patterns and two inscriptions glorifying the owner Castorius and his family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The L shaped space between the fish pool and the columns was probably planted.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. This house was made by combining several small houses. The upper garden had an unusual &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> on the north with various diameter &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>, plastered and painted red, and two &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605">pillars&lt;/a>. A third &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> on a square base supported an extension of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a>, which was a step lower and formed by an extension of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300083076">vestibule&lt;/a> at entrance 12. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180">tablinum&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> on the upper level of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> were protected from cold and rain by some sort of screen installed between the columns and the west &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605">pillar&lt;/a>. Most scholars surmise these were wooden but Maiuri proposed that they were glass, although he did not find any glass fragments during excavation (window panes surviving from this period from other sites are on display at the &lt;em>Museo Archaeologico&lt;/em> in Naples and in the &lt;em>deposito&lt;/em> at Pompeii).&lt;br>
Two steps below the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> was the garden. The back wall had a large animal &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painting&lt;/a> and a small &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> with a semicircular niche. A relief of Dianna and two deer adorned the front and inside a bronze &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> of Pomona (0.38 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 144 276) stood holding a bivalve shell filled with fruit. Water jetted from the shell, down four marble steps and into the small square &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300375619">pool&lt;/a> below. A marble covered channel divided the &lt;em>lectus medius&lt;/em> of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> in two parts and carried the water to a small jet in the center of the low &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300039548">table&lt;/a>. Four large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> supported a vine-covered pergola that shaded the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>. The soil near the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> had root cavities, as reported by Maiuri, but no further details were recorded.&lt;br>
This was the best preserved &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.40 x 0.88 m.) in the entire city. Each couch had a marble faced step along the top, and on the sides of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> was painted a series of Nilotic scenes. There were two complete &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> while the rest of the work comprised a continuous frieze. These scenes depicted Egyptian life that revolved around the periodic inundation of the Nile. Activities pictured included men fishing, a woman spinning under a canopy, worshipers visiting shrines (some shrines in enclosures, some with extensive gardens), banquet scenes, an erotic scene in a &lt;em>caupona&lt;/em>, and a pigmy slave driving a &lt;em>coclea&lt;/em> (water screw).&lt;br>
Attached to each of the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> was a low &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> (1.00 m. high) which most likely served as bases for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a>. In front and a little to the west of the &lt;em>lectus summus&lt;/em> was a large masonry base (0.93 m. high; 0.685 m. in dia.) where Maiuri surmised that the famous bronze &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> of the Ephebe stood. This statue (1.49 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 143 753) had been made into a gilded lamp stand holding candelabra brackets and was found in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097">atrium&lt;/a> where it had been wrapped and placed for protection against the impending disaster. At either end of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> was an additional pair of low circular bases for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a>. Four broken marble &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> were found in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>] where they most likely were brought for protection or perhaps for repair after the earthquake. A &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of Pan holding a fruit-filled &lt;em>calathos&lt;/em> on his left shoulder and a ramâs head in his right hand (0.60 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3682) was reconstructed from nineteen fragments. The white marble piece had been completely gilded. There was also an inebriated satyr of white marble, (the head was missing) sprawled on a gray marble rock and opening a wineskin (0.32 m. long; 0.27 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3684). Only the necklace, bracelet, and several other details were gilded on this piece. A completely gilded &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of a deer suckling a fawn (0.35 m. long; 0.22 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3683) and the remains of a gray marble base with white marble goat feet of Pan standing on a &lt;em>scabellum&lt;/em>, the typical instrument of satyrs (0.28 m. long; 0. 105 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3685) were found there. There were also four vulgar silver-plated &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> of
&lt;em>placentarii&lt;/em> or pastry vendors (each with base, 0.255 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 143 758, 143 759, 143 761, 143 761 bis). Each carried a silver tray which Maiuri surmised were used to hold food delicacies served at dinner parties in the garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> as well as the delicacies were found stored together in the house.
A trellis &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> separated the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> from the eastern part of the garden. The trellis was supported by four slender marble posts and on top of these were four small sculptured heads (herms). These pieces were: an archaic style head of Zeus rendered in white marble (0.19 m. high) with traces of bright colors, an archaic bust of Hera (0.135 m. high), a head of a woman (0.145 m. high) carved in yellow marble, and a Bacchic head of a child made from red marble. A plain round &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300039548">table&lt;/a> and a curved marble seat were found in the center of the garden. The excavation revealed soil arranged in furrows, as customary for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008142">vegetable gardens&lt;/a>, and root cavities of small plants.
Water was supplied to the garden by way of overflow channels from the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a>. A basin, with two terra-cotta openings which would regulate the flow of water to either half of the garden, was located at the edge of the garden. The south wall at the rear of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> once had a large hunt scene, but the only surviving part was the lower register. To the left of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> the images of a large deer and a bird remain, and to the right a bull flees from an unidentified attacker. A feline is crouched under a large tree in the lower right and other trees are sketchily depicted in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. This &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyle&lt;/a> garden was entered by way of seven steps from the garden of the House of the Ephebe. This part of the building had once been a separate house (19). A &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> supported by seven &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>, two of them &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001638">engaged&lt;/a>, enclosed the garden on the north and part of the east side. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> were plastered masonry, painted white on the top and red on the bottom and each had a rectangular hole, 1.70 m. from the bottom, on the side in line with the other &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>. It is speculated that these were for wooden beams that held privacy screens or mats which would shield the garden area from heat and cold. The intercolumniation in front of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> did not have these holes, as it offered a fine view on the garden. A lead pipe with a tap directed water from the garden above into a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601">dolium&lt;/a>
near the corner column. The pipe attached to the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> had been shaped to resemble a snake &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a>. Nearby a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558">cistern&lt;/a> collected water from the channels on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> roof and a puteal was located on the top of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558">cistern&lt;/a>. Eastâwest furrows were preserved in the soil and the south, west and part of the east wall of the garden had garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a>. Two large niches were located in the north wall of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> east of the garden steps and there was an arched niche in the west wall of the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a>. In the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> off the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> a broken herm of Dionysus (0.12 x 0.19), was found, which was possible a garden decoration. The walls of this &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> garden were painted with very fine garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> on part of the east wall and the other three sides. Slender painted &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> complete with painted garlands suspended between them, created the appearance of extending the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> and divided the walls into panels. The excavators found the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> had been badly damaged, the best preserved was the north panel on the west wall. This showed a slender marble crater
&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> on a decorated &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> standing in a semi-circular niche formed by a low lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a>. A photograph taken at the time of excavation shows that behind the fence the bushes represented were myrtles with an oleander on the right. In the background there was a date palm with lower leaves trimmed and new growth showing. This palm was flanked by two laurel trees (&lt;em>Laurus nobilis L.&lt;/em>). Various birds occupied the thickets and there was a bird perched on the fence, one on the rim of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> and one on one of the garlands. The center panel next to this was partially preserved and what remained was the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painting&lt;/a> of a shallow, round, bubbling &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> supported by three legs located in a three sided niche formed by the lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a>. Again there were myrtles behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> with a slender cypress on the right. Traces of a date palm remain in the center background. The center of the south wall was occupied by a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of Venus standing on a circular base, although this had to be deduced from the part of the painting which survived, which only went knee high on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a>. A fragment of a narrow animal painting survived on the west wall above a garden painting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C. Behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180">tablinum&lt;/a>, and seen from the entrance (no. 19), a small light well served as a garden. It was &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painted&lt;/a> to represent a garden and the floor had been paved. The only surviving images were the usual &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> with faint traces of oleander bushes and birds. Further traces indicated that a statuette of Venus standing on a marble base in an apsed niche in the lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> may have been represented on the east wall. The lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> on the north wall was painted to represent a rectangular niche. Water was piped from the garden above through the lower part of the rear wall and possible supplied a jet in the middle of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a>, as surmised by Maiuri.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands.
The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woolen textiles and marbles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several houses with peristyle courtyards were built north of the Areopagus in the second half of the 4th century A.D. These have been interpreted as schools of the Neoplatonic philosophers in which the school directors lived and students were instructed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these buildings, the so-called House C or Omega House, had two peristyle courtyards, of which the eastern and smallest was paved (Fig. 1). The house was assured of a constant supply of water, as it tapped into a spring higher up on the hill. The nymphaeum and semi-circular collecting basin on the southeast corner of the house were fed by this, the overflow being directed through a pipe to a well on the west side of the central, rectangular peristyle courtyard. The water taken from this well may have been used to water a garden, possibly one in the unpaved courtyard in which the well was situated (G on plan). A collection of marble statues, portrait busts, and reliefs from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. was discarded in this and other wells of the house in the first half of the 6th century, possibly at the same time Justinian ordered that pagan schools should be closed down. The house was destroyed in 582/3 after a period of Christian use.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands.
The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woolen textiles and marbles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several Roman houses in Athens make use of the remains of Classical and Hellenistic buildings, and, as far as we can tell, these houses generally had courtyards paved with marble chips, pebbles or tile set in mortar, rather than with gardens. One house on the northwest slope of the Areopagus, however, was of early Roman date and might have had a garden, since the surface of its peristyle courtyard was unpaved (Fig. 1). In the center of this courtyard was a rectangular water basin with apsidal ends, and in the southwest corner was a well.
Another only partially excavated house of the mid-4th century A.D., built into the northern slope of the Areopagus, had a small courtyard (3.20 x 3.90 m.) paved with blue and white marble slabs surrounded by a masonry flower bed 50 cm. wide (Fig. 2; f on plan). Around this ran a shallow marble-paved basin (c on plan) which was supplied with water by a fountain on the south eastern side of the courtyard. Water flowed from the basin through a lead pipe in the middle of each side of the courtyard into the planter beds.&lt;/p>
