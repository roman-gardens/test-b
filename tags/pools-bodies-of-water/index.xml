Keywords arcade (structural assemblies) bathhouse (water recreation structure) domus fountain pool (body of water) Garden Description The most visible remains from this period are a massive series of substructure arcades along the slope of the Palatine overlooking the Circus Maximus. It had been considered that this area was a thermae, a bath complex, from the time of Septimius Severus, but recent excavations and studies have shown at least part to have been occupied by the Domitianic building phase. Until the time of Maxentius, who built baths, this private wing of the palace was intended for otium and open-air promenades and was embellished with vast areas of gardens, pools and fountains.
