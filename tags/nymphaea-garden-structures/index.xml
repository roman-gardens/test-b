&lt;p>Famous for its innovative architecture, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea">&lt;em>Domus Aurea&lt;/em>&lt;/a> contained equally impressive gardens. After the fire of 64 CE, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero">Nero&lt;/a> erected this monumental residence, replacing the damaged &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Transitoria">&lt;em>Domus Transitoria&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. While the exact boundaries of the property are unknown, it is generally thought to have extended from the palaces of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_Hill">Palatine&lt;/a>, across the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velian_Hill">Velian&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppian_Hill">Oppian&lt;/a> Hills to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_of_Maecenas">&lt;em>Horti Maecenatis&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horti_Lamiani">&lt;em>Horti Lamiani&lt;/em>&lt;/a> on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquiline_Hill">Esquiline&lt;/a>, down into the valley and up to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Claudius">Temple to the Divine Claudius&lt;/a> on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caelian_Hill">Caelian&lt;/a> Hill (Fig. 1). Gardens and an artificial lake (&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300263360">&lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) were constructed in this valley, where the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum&lt;/a> now stands. Based on the ancient sources, scholars interpreted these gardens as naturalistic, but recent excavations have challenged this view (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo016.perseus-lat1:31">Suet. &lt;em>Ner.&lt;/em> 31.1–2&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-lat1:15.42">Tacitus &lt;em>Ann.&lt;/em> 15.42.1&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wing of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005734">palace&lt;/a> on the Oppian Hill was composed of sophisticated architecture and decoration typical of elite &lt;em>Horti&lt;/em> and suburban villas. The wing was oriented north-south and had commanding southern views over the valley and lake toward the Caelian. The complex probably contained two &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristyle">peristyles&lt;/a>, which could have been planted, and two &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">&lt;em>exedrae&lt;/em>&lt;/a> flanking the octagonal room may have contained gardens. Recently discovered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005073">retaining walls&lt;/a> confirm that the palace was constructed on &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004182">terraces&lt;/a>, which are likely to have held gardens. Photographs from the 1870s excavations show large numbers of &lt;a href="https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/giardinoantico/egar.asp?c=24677">&lt;em>ollae perforatae&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (planting pots) being removed, suggesting a highly constructed landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em> was located in the valley between the Palatine, Oppian, Esquiline and Caelian Hills. According to the ancient authors, around the &lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em> Nero erected buildings which looked like cities, as well as terraces of cultivated land, intermixed with woods of wild animals, and pastures of domesticated animals (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo016.perseus-lat1:31">Suet. &lt;em>Ner.&lt;/em> 31.1–2&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-lat1:15.42">Tac. &lt;em>Ann.&lt;/em> 15.42.1&lt;/a>). Therefore, scholars envisioned the &lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em> as a naturalistic lake set into a rustic, unstructured landscape dotted with groups of architecture. Excavations in the late twentieth century indicate that the &lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em> was rectilinear and enclosed by a vast &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a>. The hydraulic system for this lake was utilized in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Flavian Amphitheater&lt;/a> that replaced it. This would suggest the landscape was more structured (terraced and planned) and the effect might have been akin to the paintings of villa landscapes that survive from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">Pompeii&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Naples">Bay of Naples&lt;/a>. Excavations have also shown that the colossal statue of Nero was enclosed by a pi-shaped (or triple) &lt;em>porticus&lt;/em>, lending further support for an interpretation of constructed, planned gardens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Tiberiana">&lt;em>Domus Tiberiana&lt;/em>&lt;/a> on the Palatine was incorporated into the &lt;em>Domus Aurea&lt;/em>. Resting on &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004295">cryptoporticoes&lt;/a> and vaulted substructures, the palace was surrounded by &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002613">colonnades&lt;/a> which opened onto a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008100">hanging garden&lt;/a> (&lt;em>nemora pensile&lt;/em>), accessible from the Forum by a grand staircase on the north and another to the east.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The unfinished Temple to the Divine Claudius became a monumental &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">&lt;em>nymphaeum&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. The eastern wall of the temple platform was transformed into ornamental &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704">niched&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002526">facades&lt;/a> with abundant &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> jets fed by a new branch of the &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/423563">&lt;em>Aqua Claudia&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300010463">brick&lt;/a> remains of this &lt;em>nymphaeum&lt;/em> are visible today along the &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/688514720">&lt;em>Via Claudia&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. The water features drained into the &lt;em>stagnum&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Large garden planted with trees and decorated with a water channel (euripus), garden paintings, garden statues, and a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a> and triclinium](&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359)">http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359)&lt;/a>. Inside, a spacious &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountains&lt;/a> was decorated with flowers in planting boxes and ornamentals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. The spacious Tuscan &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097">atrium&lt;/a> of this luxurious house excavated in 1918-1921 was a lavish garden. A low, double masonry wall, faced with marble on the outside, bordered the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a> and according to Spinazzola, the space between the walls had been lined with wood to form a planting box for flowers and ornamentals. The pool had a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> base, which may have held a statuette, and bases in the center of each side may have held additional statuary. On the north side of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a> pipe remains, as well as the cavity where the pipe emerged from under the south base, were excavated. Bombing during WWII extensively damaged the other two sides but these have since been restored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. At the rear of the atrium a modest &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> garden was enclosed by a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> on the east, north and west sides. The supporting columns were smooth and colored red at the base, and fluted and white at the top. A very low wall joined all of the columns. Two circular beds in the center of the garden and a bed bordering the edges with a path between, entered from the south, were shown on the large plan by Spinazzola (see p.376). Although a dot in the center of each circular bed could represent a root cavity, no mention is made of soil contours or root cavities. A glazed terra-cotta statuette of Bes, the Egyptian deity (Pompeii inv. no. 2897) and of a pharaoh (Pompeii inv. no. 2898) were found but indications were that many other statuettes from this garden had been carried away by ancient excavators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C. A vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> terrace stretched across the back of the house immediately behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a>. Animal paintings decorated the north wall of the terrace. There were two panels of deteriorating images that had been quickly rendered. Lions, lionesses, tigers and leopards pursuing bulls, deer, gazelles and hares were noted by Spinazzola. Jashemski recorded seeing the faded images of a deer, lion, and a bull and several unidentified images in the west panel. She reported that the east panel was in poor condition but she could make out lions and a deer being attacked by an unnamed animal. At the east end of the terrace, between two masonry couches of a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a> (l. imus 2.78; l. summus 3.40 m.), two columns framed an &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> niche. To the wall right of the niche was a painting of Pyramus and Thisbe, to the left a painting of Narcissus. A marble telamon in the form of a kneeling satyr (Pompeii inv. no. 2891) found on the terrace was thought by Spinazzola to have been a fountain head. This would have stood on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> with a basin on his shoulders, spilling water down into the channel. Dr. Salza Prina Ricotti disagreed, pointing out that there is no evidence of piping either in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> or the statuette. The channel, or euripus, measured 1.00 m. wide and 1.40 m. deep and extended 20 m. along the terrace. The inside of the channel was painted blue and small statues were set in the narrow strip of garden along the sides. Proceeding from east to west, the statues were as follows: on the south side, the head of a bearded Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2910); across the channel on the north side, the bust of a young Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2918); next on the south, a lion holding a ram’s head (Pompeii inv. no. 2922); across from this, a lion devouring an antelope (Pompeii inv. no. 2929); next on the south, the mask of a woman sculptured in a console (Pompeii inv. no. 2928); opposite this, a sphinx (Pompeii inv. no. 2930); next on the north side, a seated baby satyr with head and hands raised (Pompeii inv. no. 2931)(this piece disappeared in 1960); an infant Hercules strangling two serpents (Pompeii inv. no. 2932); opposite this, a greyhound attacking a hare (Pompeii inv. no. 2934). A bearded river god (Pompeii inv. no. 2932) looked down the channel from its source, and on the base between the pillars of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> stood a statue of the Muse Polyhymnia (Pompeii inv. no. 2917) and one of Mnemosyne (Pompeii inv. no. 2909). These two marble statues bore traces of paint. The channel was crossed by two small bridges, one crossing by the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a>. The other crossed in front of the grand triclinium opening just off the north side of the terrace. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> offered a view across the bridge to a tetrastyle pavilion. Here fountains spouted water into the channel at the edge of the plinth of the pavilion. The lower garden that extended the length of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000325">insula&lt;/a> could be viewed from this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>D. A nymphaeum in the lower garden was located directly under the tetrastyle pavilion. Water cascaded into this from the pavilion and the upper channel. Brightly colored paintings of fish surrounded a marble mask of a water deity on the rear wall of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">nymphaeum&lt;/a>. Just below, seated above little marble steps where the water tumbled down to the channel, was a marble amorino holding a mask (0.236 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 20513). The narrow channel continued more than 50 meters down the length of the garden and was interrupted by three structures. Before the first pergola, three jets of water issued from two low columns and a pillar spaced evenly in the channel. The vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> covered an elaborate fountain where water issued from the center of the structure and flowed down four steps in four directions to the pool. A small pavilion was built over the next pool and the final pool had another vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> shading a jet of water near the end of the channel. Although this series of pools and channels varied, they were all connected as one feature. Spinazzola suggested that the pools were used for raising different species of fish which would have separate habitat requirements. Shade and cover for the fish would have been supplied by the pavilion and hollows in the first marble fountain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was evidence of long vine &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781">arbors&lt;/a> on each side of the channel and cavities of large shade trees lined the side walls, although no measurements were recorded. On the east side of the garden by the row of shade trees, forty-four &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300148696">amphorae&lt;/a> were found buried in the soil. Rows of smaller trees or shrubs filled the area between the shade trees and the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781">arbors&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A masonry &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> stood to the east of the first fountain and here two sculptured supports for a marble table were found. The west side of the covered passageway once had wooden benches, and near the wall at the south end of the garden a one-third life size statuette of a sleeping hermaphrodite (Pompeii inv. no. 3021) was discovered. An entrance from the Via di Castricio allowed direct access to the garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The entrance of this house (Fig. 1) (which takes its name from the statuary group found in room b) provides access to a large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> (a) with four columns on marble bases, resting on a continuous marble-paneled &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001989">balustrade&lt;/a> 50 cm high. To the right of the portico was an area believed to be a garden (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium">&lt;em>viridarium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) (c) terminating in a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">nymphaeum&lt;/a>. This consisted of a podium 1.10 m. high, paneled in white marble. Hewn into its front side are five deep circular niches. Four are paneled in white marble; only the central niche is panelled in green &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipollino_marble">cipollino marble&lt;/a>. The architectural elevation of the nymphaeum rises from this podium (Fig. 2). Over four meters high, it consists of two rectangular alternating with three semicircular niches, framed by six marble columns with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_order">Corinthian&lt;/a> capitals and rectangular travertine &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001749">plinths&lt;/a>, from which little brick arches project. Five marble stepped gradients were placed between the bases of the columns. They formed miniature cascades: the water piped in by the lead conduit that ran along the bases of the niches flowed down over them. The water filled small rectangular basins and, flowing through &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300010669">terracotta&lt;/a> channels inside the podium, spouted from four outlets placed between the niches. The whole of the podium together with the stepped cascades was paneled in white marble and green &lt;em>cipollino&lt;/em>; the upper part, by contrast, was stuccoed and adorned with a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300252261">polychrome&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015342">wall mosaic&lt;/a>. A tile-covered drain ran through the entire length of the podium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium">&lt;em>viridarium&lt;/em>&lt;/a> is the main source of light for all the rooms that face on it, including the large reception room (d) (Fig. 3). The house is a typical example of an Ostian patrician house of the early 4th century CE.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 4&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-b/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->-3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> century CE “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyle&lt;/a> garden (Fig. 1, a) has &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011329">travertine&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> on three sides. The fourth side coincides with the perimeter wall of the house, which forms part of the original plan, dating to the 2nd century CE. The last phase of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, lavishly decorated with precious marbles, dates to the 4th century CE. Against the rear wall of the garden is a brick &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704">niche&lt;/a> (h. 194 cm.; w. 114 cm.) containing a statue of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)">Juno&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter">Demeter&lt;/a> and two benches in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_vittatum">&lt;em>opus listatum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (w. 41 cm.; preserved h. 28 cm.). “The area inside the peristyle must undoubtedly have been kept as a garden (Figs. 2 and 3). The remains of a rectangular basin (3.10x5.40 m.) with drainage outlet at its north-east corner were found at its center” (Becatti).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300152327">well&lt;/a> (diam. 49 cm.) in the eastern part of the garden; it is adorned with a marble &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300443458">well-head&lt;/a> decorated with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300030853">bucrania&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020212">neo-attic&lt;/a> style, dating to the 2nd century CE (dia. 66 cm; h. 55 cm) (Fig. 4). Two small &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047170">herms&lt;/a> also formed part of the garden decoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A large female &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> was found &lt;em>in situ&lt;/em> on its pedestal, adhering to the end-wall of the western portico of the peristyle. Endowed with the attributes of trade (&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300303413">cornucopia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubernaculum_(classical)">oar&lt;/a>), the female figure has been identified as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna">&lt;em>Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, the personification of Ostia’s trading success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large apsidal reception room (&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080791">&lt;em>oecus&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) (Fig. 1, b), with two columns marking its entrance, was located in the western part of the house. The garden, with flowering plants, onto which it opens, formed its natural continuation. This, together with the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">&lt;em>nymphaeum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> that decorated the south side of the room, its rear wall articulated with alternating semicircular and rectangular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704">niches&lt;/a> containing statues, provided a suitably splendid and prestige-enhancing setting for the public life of the owner, probably a wealthy trader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The garden also forms the backdrop to the rooms in the east part of the house, a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">&lt;em>triclinium&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (Fig. 1, c) and a heated cubicle (Fig. 1, d), lit by a large window and decorated with a lavish black and white &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015342">mosaic&lt;/a> floor with mythological scenes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Late Hellenistic houses of Delos the &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> of peristyle courtyards were usually paved, and rainwater falling into these courtyards was emptied as wastewater by sewers into nearby streets. However, in two large houses (Quarter of the Theater, Insula II, Houses E and F) and two clubhouses of associations (House of Fourni; Quarter of the Stadium, Insula I, building B, the so-called perfumery) the &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> of the peristyle courtyards were not paved, with the exception of some scattered stone settings. Whereas one of them might have been left unfinished in a phase of remodeling (Quarter of the Theater, insula II, House F), the others were certainly all used, comprising of different phases of enlargement and embellishment. Thus, the lack of pavement cannot be due to the unfinished state of the buildings, but must have been deliberate. The sizes of these &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> range from 30.20 square meters to 75.80 square meters. In all cases no cistern was established under the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em>, as is usual in Delian buildings with peristyles. Furthermore, all four peristyle courtyards are provided with a sewer for the drainage of rain and waste water; the earthen floor of the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> could probably not absorb the occasional large quantities of rain water pouring down in heavy storms, so that at least some of the rain water had to be drained away. So far, planting was only proposed for the courtyard of the so-called perfumery, but no specialized examinations or excavations were performed in any of the four courtyards. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, some other features might speak in favor of luxurious garden-peristyles for these Delian buildings. In Delian private buildings, peristyle gardens were probably introduced rather late, during the heyday of the free port in the three or four decades before 88 B.C. Within the local context, the Agora of the Italians could have served as the most immediate model for this new fashion. The design of these gardens would have been simple. They would have consisted mostly of small trees, shrubs, and plants, which did not need much water. All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core building of the &lt;strong>House of Fourni&lt;/strong> is arranged along a main axis with rooms on at least three different levels (Fig. 1). The main rooms were not oriented towards the south, as is usual in Delos, but towards the west, thus providing a view of the nearby bay of Fourni and the sea. A kind of nymphaeum (k), carved out of the natural rock and placed exactly on the main axis of the building, was added subsequently to the eastern façade of the building. A broad staircase led from the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> of the courtyard (q) to a large raised room in the east (j), a remarkably open &lt;em>oecus maior&lt;/em> with doors on three sides and an opening to the nymphaeum on the fourth side. Therefore, the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> of 75.80 square meters will have been frequently used and would certainly have been paved, had it not been conceived for a special purpose like planting. Today, the courtyard is (again?) covered with small shrubs. The overall design and some other features like &lt;em>opus signinum&lt;/em> pavements (rooms i, h and o) and ‘liturgical’ paintings for the cult of the &lt;em>lares compitales&lt;/em>, a cult usually performed by slaves and liberti of Italians or Romans, point to a Roman or Italian association, which might have introduced some new fashionable traits into Delian private architecture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands.

&lt;p>The so-called &lt;strong>perfumery&lt;/strong> was equipped with a Rhodian peristyle (e), an open &lt;em>oecus maior&lt;/em> with colonnades and doors on all four sides (m-n), and with a kind of nymphaeum-reservoir (p) (Figs. 1, 2). The latter opened off the &lt;em>oecus maior&lt;/em> and was placed on the visual axis of the main entrance. Perfume was produced in a large exedra (f), which was connected with the peristyle to its north by an Ionic colonnade. The overall design is as unique as in the House of Fourni and could well have comprised a peristyle with a stylish garden of 51.20 square meters. A Roman or Italian association might have owned this clubhouse because Romans and Italians showed particular interest in the perfume trade. Slaves and liberti of several gentes that are attested in Delos distinguished themselves as &lt;em>thurarii&lt;/em> (dealers of incense) in the Mediterranean world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Late Hellenistic houses of Delos the &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> of peristyle courtyards were usually paved, and rainwater falling into these courtyards was emptied as wastewater by sewers into nearby streets. However, in two large houses (Quarter of the Theater, Insula II, Houses E and F) and two clubhouses of associations (House of Fourni; Quarter of the Stadium, Insula I, building B, the so-called perfumery) the &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> of the peristyle courtyards were not paved, with the exception of some scattered stone settings. Whereas one of them might have been left unfinished in a phase of remodeling (Quarter of the Theater, insula II, House F), the others were certainly all used, comprising of different phases of enlargement and embellishment. Thus, the lack of pavement cannot be due to the unfinished state of the buildings, but must have been deliberate. The sizes of these &lt;em>impluvia&lt;/em> range from 30.20 square meters to 75.80 square meters. In all cases no cistern was established under the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em>, as is usual in Delian buildings with peristyles. Furthermore, all four peristyle courtyards are provided with a sewer for the drainage of rain and waste water; the earthen floor of the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> could probably not absorb the occasional large quantities of rain water pouring down in heavy storms, so that at least some of the rain water had to be drained away. So far, planting was only proposed for the courtyard of the so-called perfumery, but no specialized examinations or excavations were performed in any of the four courtyards. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, some other features might speak in favor of luxurious garden-peristyles for these Delian buildings. In Delian private buildings, peristyle gardens were probably introduced rather late, during the heyday of the free port in the three or four decades before 88 B.C. Within the local context, the Agora of the Italians could have served as the most immediate model for this new fashion. The design of these gardens would have been simple. They would have consisted mostly of small trees, shrubs, and plants, which did not need much water. All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three-sided peristyle in the courtyard (b) of &lt;strong>House E&lt;/strong> in the insula II of the Quarter of the theater comprised a large rectangular altar in its center (Figs. 1, 2). An exedra with two columns (f) opened to the north and was only accessible via the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em>. Again, this arrangement would have required frequent use of the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> and, therefore, even more so its systematic pavement. Instead, the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> of 48.80 square meters, which is only equipped with some scattered stone slabs, was probably transformed into a kind of sacred garden. Two altars at either side of the entrance, which were probably combined with ‘liturgical’ paintings, might indicate that a Roman or Italian owned this house at least for a certain period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether the &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em> of 30.20 square meters (a) of &lt;strong>House F&lt;/strong> in insula II of the Quarter of the Theater was left unfinished or planned or even realized as a garden, cannot be decided (Figs. 1, 3). Following the latest fashion, the initiators of the last major transformation of this house might well have conceived of a planted &lt;em>impluvium&lt;/em>. This house, however, was not (yet?) equipped with any water supply.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands.
The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woollen textiles and marbles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A large (20,000 sq. m.) villa on a small hill near the ancient site of Eua has been systematically excavated since the 1980s. Most of the discoveries, however, remain unpublished. Because the earliest remains date to the Flavian period and an inscription mentions the name Hipparchus, father of Herodes Atticus (103-171 A.D.), it is likely that this was family property inherited by Herodes and transformed by him into one of the most luxurious Roman estates in Greece.
At the center of the plan was a large garden defined on three sides (north, south, and east) by porticoes paved in mosaics representing various mythological scenes in a continuous sequence (850 sq. m.). The numerous statues placed in the garden, representing divinities, historical characters, athletes, and philosophers, were part of a decorative program in which the sculptural and mosaic themes were linked. For example, in the north portico, in front of a mosaic depicting Menelaus holding the body of Patroclus, fragments of a statuary group representing the same subject were found (“Pasquino” type). In the south portico, a sculpture of Achilles and Penthesilea (copy of a second century B.C. original from Pergamon) was found in front of a mosaic with the same subject. Other mosaic subjects are the hunt of Aeneas and Dido, the Horai and Charites, the labors of Heracles, and cupids making wine. The eastern part of the villa had a nymphaeum and an exedra, containing six statues depicting girls, one of which dates to the fifth century B.C. The villa also had a Serapeum and an Antinoön.
After the death of Herodes the villa probably became imperial property. A phase dating to the Tetrarchy is attested, and during the time of Constantine a mosaic, depicting the Circus Maximus, was added. The villa was destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 400 A.D. and by the invasions of the Goths.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several houses with peristyle courtyards were built north of the Areopagus in the second half of the 4th century A.D. These have been interpreted as schools of the Neoplatonic philosophers in which the school directors lived and students were instructed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these buildings, the so-called House C or Omega House, had two peristyle courtyards, of which the eastern and smallest was paved (Fig. 1). The house was assured of a constant supply of water, as it tapped into a spring higher up on the hill. The nymphaeum and semi-circular collecting basin on the southeast corner of the house were fed by this, the overflow being directed through a pipe to a well on the west side of the central, rectangular peristyle courtyard. The water taken from this well may have been used to water a garden, possibly one in the unpaved courtyard in which the well was situated (G on plan). A collection of marble statues, portrait busts, and reliefs from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. was discarded in this and other wells of the house in the first half of the 6th century, possibly at the same time Justinian ordered that pagan schools should be closed down. The house was destroyed in 582/3 after a period of Christian use.&lt;/p>
