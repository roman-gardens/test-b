Keywords portico peristyle [dolia](http ://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601) Garden Description These two shops, excavated in 1861, shared a house and a garden (a) to the back. A portico enclosed the garden on all four sides. In the southwest corner of the garden there was a masonry pool with a small water jet column in the center. A bronze basin 0.40 m. dia. with a miniature bronze lion fitted with a water jet was found on the right side of the peristyle, with the feet of the basin welded in the form of a ring. This was also the area where a fragment of the head of a statuette was found, and a marble monopodium was discovered nearby. Along the edge of the eastern half of the garden seven enormous dolia were embedded in the soil.
