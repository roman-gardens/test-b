Keywords aedicula atrium podium herm statuette thymiaterion candelabrum Garden Description A large aedicula shrine was built against the rear wall of this long garden (a) directly across from the north side of the atrium, which was entirely open to this view. The shrine stood on a podium 2.00 x 2.15 m.; 0.80 m. high with four steps in front and a marble herm on either side. Two little brick columns supported a roof over a marble statuette of Diana with a marble thymiaterion before it. A broken marble candelabrum was found at the foot of the steps when this site was excavated in 1839. Jashemski reports that the head and right arm of the statuette were found first and later the rest of the statuette was uncovered in good condition, however, she was unable to find any record of the statuette in the Museo Nazionale and speculated that the Princess of Saxony, who was present at the excavation, may have been given possession of the statuette. Another aedicula shrine with an altar was located in the northwest corner of the garden.

Keywords portico peristyle tablinium triclinium exedra puteals atrium impluvia Garden Description Eighteen partially fluted columns supported the large portico (a) surrounding this spacious peristyle garden. Excavated in 1861, the garden was located at the rear of the tablinum and could be viewed from the large triclinium on the east or the exedra on the west. A wooden fence had enclosed the garden as evidenced by the vertical slots in the columns where the fence had been secured. The portico held two puteals, one marble and the other travertine. A gutter circled the garden and at the south end a pool 0.90 x 1.05 m.; 0.18 m. deep contained a fountain. There was also a fountain located in the atrium, which became a common house feature after the completion of the aquaduct. At the edge of the marble impluvium two ornate trapezophori flanked a round opening containing the bronze water key that controlled the water jet in the center of the impluvium.

The triclinium on the south and the neighbor’s house on the west received light from this garden.

Keywords insula portico opus signinum Garden Description The atrium at the front of this house had been converted into a bakery. Towards the back a portico surrounded a small area (a). The portico columns were black at the base and red above, three on the north and three on the south and were connected by a low wall 0.47 m. high, but only the bases survived. The interior area was paved with opus signinum and in the middle there was a rectangle lined with white and gray marble, a yellow marble cross with a red bordered yellow square in the center. This has sustained much damage since it was exposed. At the outside of the paved area there was a gutter with a cistern opening located between the columns on the west side. This area may have contained potted plants. The portico could be entered directly from entrance no. 9 and various rooms opened off of it, the room on the east (b) had the best view into the portico.

The entrance at 37 went into the atrium and beyond that, up two steps, was the peristyle with a portico on three sides supported by stuccoed columns, only three of which have remained to date. The first intercolumniation on the north-east was filled with a wall. A gutter surrounded this area, which was paved, with a narrow masonry pool at the south end. All that remained of the pool was a depression in the pavement. Potted plants would have been placed around the pool and the area would have served as a garden. Terraces overlooking the bay and mountains were located on the street level and one level lower at the back of the houses, and a portico was built just before the lower terrace at the back of house 36.
