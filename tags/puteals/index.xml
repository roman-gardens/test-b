Keywords portico peristyle tablinium triclinium exedra puteals atrium impluvia Garden Description Eighteen partially fluted columns supported the large portico (a) surrounding this spacious peristyle garden. Excavated in 1861, the garden was located at the rear of the tablinum and could be viewed from the large triclinium on the east or the exedra on the west. A wooden fence had enclosed the garden as evidenced by the vertical slots in the columns where the fence had been secured. The portico held two puteals, one marble and the other travertine. A gutter circled the garden and at the south end a pool 0.90 x 1.05 m.; 0.18 m. deep contained a fountain. There was also a fountain located in the atrium, which became a common house feature after the completion of the aquaduct. At the edge of the marble impluvium two ornate trapezophori flanked a round opening containing the bronze water key that controlled the water jet in the center of the impluvium.

Keywords portico puteals Garden Description A public garden laid out to the specifications of Vitruvius originally occupied the area at the rear of the Great Theater. There was a seventy four column portico enclosing an area with green plots of trees and shrubs and pathways for promenades. In the later years of the city the colonnade was converted into gladiator barracks and the green space became the training field. A gutter surrounded the area to collect the roof run off. There were two puteals in the east portico.
